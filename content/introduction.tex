\chapter{Introduction}

% Explain the problem

In human languages, it is possible that the same word has different meanings
according to the context in which it is used. For example:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
 \item She shot the arrow using her \textit{bow}.
 \item He tied the \textit{bow} of the gift.
\end{enumerate}

In these two sentences, the word \textit{bow} means different things. In
sentence (a) it is used as a hunting tool, while in sentence (b) it is a ribbon.
To be able to do some tasks in \ac{NLP}, machines need to be able to
differentiate between each use of the same word.

% Show why the problem is ubiquitous

This problem affects, among other \ac{NLP} tasks, \ac{MT}, \ac{IR} and content
categorization \citep{navigli2009word}. Taking an example from \ac{MT}, the
Portuguese word \textit{laço} can be translated in various different English
words depending on context; it can be translated into \textit{ribbon} or it can
be translated to the \textit{bond} between two people. A system which naïvely
uses the \ac{MFS} may improperly translate or categorize this word when it is
used outside of its most common context.

% Introduce the solution to the problem

To deal with this problem it is necessary to identify the underlying meaning of
a word based on its context. This process is called \ac{WSD}
\citep{navigli2009word}. This process requires both sense inventories as well as
large amounts of sense-tagged \emph{corpora} to function efficiently. As a
result, under-resourced languages need to deal with greater hardships to be
able to achieve satisfactory results \citep{ng1997getting}.

A solution to the lack of resources is to automatically identify the meaning of
words in their given context, without the requirement of manually annotated
data. This is called \ac{WSI} \citep{agirre2007semeval}.

% Propose questions which this paper will answer

% Is it possible?
% Does it execute within reasonable limits?
% Can it be better than no induction/disambiguation?
% How do you evaluate it? Aka, how do you know it is better?

The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the feasibility of creating a
\ac{WSI} model for the Portuguese language which is capable of improving the
quality of detected word senses within the words' contexts. Furthermore, this
dissertation looks into seeing if the task of \ac{WSI} and \ac{WSD} can be
performed within reasonable time, and to evaluate the quality of this new model
against the \ac{MFS} baseline.

% Introduce the shiny new tool, explain the problem it solves

Additionally, this dissertation presents the results of this investigation, in
a project called \ac{SENTIDO}. \ac{SENTIDO} is a \ac{WSI} and \ac{WSD} model
which infers the possible senses of a word from untagged \emph{corpora} based
on the additional words that co-occur with the target word; and, given a word
and its context, disambiguates between the previously inferred senses.

% Describe the layout of this paper

This dissertation is organized as follows:

In Chapter~\ref{ch:stateofart}, existing \ac{WSI} implementations and models
are described, as well and the theoretical foundations and additional tools
that support and aide them. In Chapter~\ref{ch:architecture}, the architecture
of the model is outlined, as well as the various stages that compose it. In
Chapter~\ref{ch:implementation}, the implementation details, such as the
\emph{corpora} used, existing tools from which the model is developed, and
adaptations made to those same tools, are depicted.
Chapter~\ref{ch:eval} describes how the algorithm is tested, which are the
theoretical foundations for the soundness of the methodology, the test corpus
used, the chosen parameters and analyses the results of the evaluation.
Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion} provides a synopsis of the findings and describes
what can be improved in the future.
