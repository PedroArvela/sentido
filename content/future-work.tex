\chapter{Future Work}
\label{ch:future}

One important aspect to investigate is the possibility of adding more
dependency types to the ones detected by Syntax Deep Explorer
\citep{correia2015syntax}. Not only would these help improve the results 
obtained
by \ac{SENTIDO} as they would also be useful for Syntax Deep Explorer's original
goal.

Another aspect would be to investigate further clustering algorithms, such as
\ac{B-MST} \citep{marco2013clustering} or HyperLex \citep{veronis2004hyperlex}, 
as
they could help improve the results of both the induction and the disambiguation
phase.

Another point worth investigating is further processing before or after
generating the graph or during induction, such as choosing different association
measures and thresholds, or including information about the dependency patterns
themselves in the generated clusters for when applying the disambiguation
\citep{panchenko2016noun}.

Additionally, it might be relevant to investigate porting the data to a graph
database engine, as it's native work in graphs might improve the execution speed
of the induction phase by removing several of the currently required
\texttt{JOIN}s of multiple tables in relational databases.
