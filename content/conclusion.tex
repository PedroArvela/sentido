This project proposed an algorithm for disambiguating the sense of words in the
Portuguese language without the need to manually create a sense inventory or
sense-tagged corpora. Additionally, this project implemented a proof-of-concept
of this same proposal, and evaluated its results against a \ac{MFS} baseline.

One important aspect to investigate is the possibility of adding more
dependency types to the ones detected by Syntax Deep Explorer
\citep{correia2015syntax}. Not only would these help improve the results
obtained
by \ac{SENTIDO} as they would also be useful for Syntax Deep Explorer's original
goal.

Another aspect would be to investigate further clustering algorithms, such as
\ac{B-MST} \citep{marco2013clustering} or HyperLex \citep{veronis2004hyperlex},
as
they could help improve the results of both the induction and the disambiguation
phase.

Another point worth investigating is what should be further processed between
the stages of induction, such as choosing different association measures and
thresholds, or including information about the dependency types themselves in
the generated graphs, to later use when applying the disambiguation
\citep{panchenko2016noun}.

Additionally, it might be relevant to investigate porting the data to a graph
database engine, as its native work in graphs might improve the execution speed
of the induction phase by removing several of the currently required
\texttt{JOIN}s of multiple tables in relational databases.

Although the project was unable to achieve satisfactory results in the
evaluation, it was possible to pinpoint were possible weaknesses were and a base
model was defined and documented, which can be used for future attempts at
solving the given problem.
