\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{ch:stateofart}

In this chapter the state of the art is described. The overall approaches and
their principles are described, as well as the various algorithms used to
exploit those same principles.

\section{Distributional Semantics}

\acp{DSM} discover word senses from text. These are based on the
\textit{Distributional Hypothesis}, which says that \textit{similar terms
appear in similar contexts} \cite{curran2004distributional}. That is, words are
semantically similar if they appear in similar documents, context windows or
syntactic contexts \cite{van2010mining}.

Using syntactic contexts adds a restriction to what can be considered context of
a word. For a word to be in the context of another, it needs to be linked
through the use of a relevant syntactic or lexical relation
\cite{baroni2010distributional}.
