\label{ch:stateofart}

In this chapter the state of the art is described. The overall approaches and
their principles are described, as well as the various algorithms used to
exploit those same principles.

\section{Distributional Semantics}

\acp{DSM} discover word senses from text. These are based on the 
\textit{Distributional Hypothesis}, which says that \textit{You shall know a 
word by the company it keeps} \citep{firth1957papers}. That is, words are 
semantically similar if they appear in similar documents, context windows or 
syntactic contexts \citep{van2010mining}.
