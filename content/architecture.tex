\chapter{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

The architecture of this project is composed of four components:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A corpora pre-parser, which prepares the corpora being used to be
processed by \ac{STRING};
  \item The co-occurrence extractor from \cite{correia2015syntax};
  \item A graph constructor and clustering algorithm;
  \item A sense disambiguation module.
\end{enumerate}

The data follows the flow exemplified in Figure~\ref{fig:data-progression}. The
processed text from \ac{STRING} goes through a modified implementation of the
co-occurrence extractor from \cite{correia2015syntax}, which stores the
co-occurrences along with their frequencies and association measures in a
database.
