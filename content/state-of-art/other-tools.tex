\section{Other Tools}

In addition to the existing work in \ac{WSD} and \ac{WSI}, it is relevant to
mention other works which make use of word co-occurrences in text.

\subsection{Syntax Deep Explorer}

In \cite{correia2015syntax}, a tool was developed to make use of \ac{STRING} to
allow one to explore co-occurrence data obtained from Portuguese texts. The
presented solution was composed of a tool to extract co-occurrences in and a
web-based interface to display these in an intuitive fashion.

The developed solution takes advantage of the rich lexical resources extracted
and the syntactic and semantic analysis of \ac{STRING} to provide information
about the patterns of co-occurrences found in the corpora evaluated.

\subsubsection{Architecture}

The implemented solution split the problem into four separate components:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The storage format of the extracted and computed information;
 \item The co-occurrence extraction from the corpus;
 \item The calculation of the various association measures;
 \item The display of the information in an user-friendly form.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Storage Format}

A database was chosen as the format to store the obtained information. An
\ac{ER} model was developed to represent the database, and a relational model
was generated from the created \ac{ER} model.
